                            We may disclose your personal data as permitted by law in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violation of our intellectual property rights, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violation of our Terms and Conditions or other agreements, or as required by law.
                            4. TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EU/EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
                            We share your personal data with our affiliates and partners in the EU/EEA and outside the EU/EEA. Where a data transfer outside the EU/EEA is not covered by an EU Commission adequacy decision, we rely on lawful safeguards referred to in Art 46 et. seqq. GDPR. This mainly includes EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses which we enhanced by supplementary security measures such as ancillary individual risk-assessments, additional contractual safeguards and technical safeguards including additional encryption or pseudonymisation, to enable International transfers with Company affiliates and partners outside the EU/EEA. You will find the full text of the EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses through this link. Please feel free to contact us for additional information on third country data transfers as well as our safeguards and supplementary security measures.
                            
                            We share personal data with external vendors or service providers or suppliers that we engage to perform services or functions on our behalf and under our instructions. Where these vendors are located within the EU, we ensure that they are contractually obligated to comply with the EU data protection rules. We also ensure in our contracts with these organizations that they only Process Personal Data in accordance with our instructions and in order to provide the agreed services and protect the integrity and confidentiality of your personal data entrusted to them.
                            We may also disclose personal data to our advisers, consultants, law enforcement and other public authorities (such as tax and social security bodies), the police, prosecutors, courts and tribunals. All these recipients are themselves responsible to comply with the EU data protection rules.
                            Some of the vendors that we engage in are located outside the European Economic Area. Where the EU Commission did not recognise them as locations providing adequate protection for personal data, we rely on lawful safeguards as described above.
                            You may request a copy of these agreements by contacting us using the email address in the Who is Responsible for Processing Your Data and How to Contact Us section above.

You can also limit, restrict or object to the processing of your data.

Please note that even if you withdraw your consent, we can still rely on the consent you gave as the lawful basis for processing your personal data before you withdraw your consent.

We explained the legitimate interests we rely on in sections ‘Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?’ above.
                            
                            If you would like to exercise any of your above rights, you may contact us as set forth in the Who is Responsible for Processing Your Data and How to Contact Us section above.
